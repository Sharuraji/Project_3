By : Naqibullah Falak , Mana Naseri , Santosh Poudel, Sharu Raji 

Project Overview

This project focuses on Agriculture of India from 2010 to 2020. 

Three main criteria including, Season, Crops and Crop year are going to be different factor in mean production in India.

Crop Season is divided in four group: Summer, Rabi, Kharif and Winter.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. The data shows the District, State, Crop, Crop Year, Season and Production and Yield in India from 2001 to 2020. 

# Data Analysis

We used Python and Panda to clean the data, filter it and get the mean of production for crop in different years and different seasons. 

# Visualization
1)	Bar graph shows the Arecanut Production in different years from 2015 to 2020.  
2)	Next Bar graph shows the three-crop production in different years from 2010 to 2020. 
3)	We used scatter plot with the use of Seaborn Python shows crop production in different years. 
4)	Pair plot
5)	It shows API  google map. 



# Web Application

With the help of Flask application (app.py) we connected the database to HTML. And by having index.html we could use the browser and visualize the data. 

We also used API which stands for Application Programming Interface.
With the help API we could locate the Indiaâ€™s geometric and analyze the crop production in different state and district. 

# Presentation 

All the graphs and finding are summarized in the Canvas. Some of the photos in the presentation are taken from Canvas website. 


# Ethical Considerations

In our group we made sure to source our data (APY India.csv) to give credit to the author and acknowledge their hard work for gathering data. 

Furthermore, our data is more than 300,000 samples which reduces errors and give us more flexibility to analyze data.

Moreover, as a group made sure to include all team member and follow inclusion and diversity in our group meetings.
