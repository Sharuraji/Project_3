# Agriculture in India 
By: Naqibullah Falak, Mana Naseri, Santosh Poudel, Sharu Raji 

# Project Overview
This project focuses on Agriculture of India from 2010 to 2020. 

Three main criteria including, Season, Crops and Crop year are going to be different factor in mean production in India.

Crop Season is divided in four group: Summer, Rabi, Kharif and Winter.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. The data shows the District, State, Crop, Crop Year, Season and Production and Yield in India from 2001 to 2020. 

# Data Analysis
We used Python and Panda to clean the data, filter it and get the mean of production for crop in different years and different seasons. 

# Visualization
1)	Bar graph shows the Arecanut Production in different years from 2015 to 2020.  
2)	Next Bar graph shows the three-crop production in different years from 2010 to 2020. 
3)	We used scatter plot and bar graph with the use of Seaborn Python library which we never used before in the class and shows crop production in different years. 
4)	Pair plot
5)	It shows API google map. 


# Gathering Data and Web Application 
We gathered the data in csv from Kaggle website and by the SQLite database we housed the data.
Then with the help of Flask (App.py) we connected JavaScript to HTM And by having index.html we could use the browser and visualize the data. 
In Html file, we defined the layout and text. By setting up the flask we could web applications easily. And JavaScript helped us to add dynamic behavior to your webpage. 
We also used API which stands for Application Programming Interface.
With the help API we could locate the Indiaâ€™s geometric and analyze the crop production in different state and district. 

# Instructions
Run the project locally.
1.	Clone the repository to your computer. 
2.	Install all the necessary Python libraries such as Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQlite3, panda.
3.	Run the Flask application (app.py).
4.	Open the provided URL in your web browser to view the visualizations.
5.	Presentation can be viewed in canvas https://www.canva.com/design/DAGDECQObj8/NVw4SPlRjM7Bzah2Kb0-bQ/edit

# Ethical Considerations
In our group we made sure to source our data (APY India.csv) to give credit to the author and acknowledge their hard work for gathering data. 

Furthermore, our data is more than 300,000 samples which reduces errors and give us more flexibility to analyze data.

Moreover, as a group made sure to include all team member and follow inclusion and diversity in our group meetings. 

# Presentation 
All the graphs and finding are summarized in the Canvas. Some of the photos in the presentation are taken from Canvas website.
